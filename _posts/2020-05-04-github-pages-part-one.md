In what I believe to be a very "meta move", my first blog post will be about
how I created this blog. I found creating this site to be a trivial activity,
but as with a lot of activities, the first 80% was the easy part. The last 20%
then turned into consumption of a lot of "spare time" reading random blog posts and code to
get to comfortable with publishing something. This post is part of
series that documents the journey, in the hopes that it will be easier for
others.

## Why I chose GitHub Pages and first steps

### Why GitHub Pages?

My reasoning for choosing GitHub Pages is as follows:

- Opportunity to learn git and I liked the appeal of having the blog under source
  code control
- Free with no goofy ads interspersed across the pages
- Secure: specifically use of SSL out of the box without me managing certs
- No wish to manage any infrastructure on my part
- No DNS to manage with a reasonable name for the blog.

### Leverage GitHub Labs

As I started looking at using GitHub, I got a wee-bit overwhelmed with all the
websites and youtube videos trying to sort things out with git and GitHub
pages.

Luckily I will not be writing up yet another git 101 blog page. I recommend
that you leverage the following three [GitHub Labs](https://lab.github.com):

- [Introduction to GitHub](https://lab.github.com/githubtraining/introduction-to-github)

The lab focused on the basics of git in an interactive way: create clone,edit
files, commit changes, push to the repo and open a pull request.

- [Communicating using Markdown](https://lab.github.com/githubtraining/communicating-using-markdown)

Quick Markdown basics course.

- [GitHub Pages](https://lab.github.com/githubtraining/github-pages)

How to enable GitHub Pages, choose themes, YAML front matter, create and edit
blog posts.
